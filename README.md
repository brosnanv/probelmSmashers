-----------------Project Description-----------------

This is the second assignment for the CS7IS2 module. This project looks at solving an artificial intelligence problem using three different families of search algorithims

The problem selected is: Standardised Sudoku
Aim: To fill a 9x9 grid with digits so that each column, each row and each 3x3 of the nine subgrids that compose the grid contain all digits from 1 tom 9. 

The search algorithims compared are: 

DFS Back Tracking 

Harmony Search 

Simulated Annealing
